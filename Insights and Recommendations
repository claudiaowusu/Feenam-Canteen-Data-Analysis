# Key insights

Pepper is the dominant trigger: up to ≈ 4 % of diners who choose “Rice & Stew” flag a pepper/spice allergy, and most pepper-heavy meals show ≥ 2 %.
Secondary concerns pop up for dairy and nuts, especially in rice-based stews (≈ 2 % each). Other classic allergens scarcely appear in the free-text, so they are not top-of-mind for this cohort.
The absolute “risk” remains highest for very popular dishes (Banku, Rice & Stew, Jollof) because volume × moderate allergy-rate = many affected diners.

# Operational recommendations

Menu labelling
– Add a clear “🌶 Hot/Pepper” icon next to all pepper-rich meals.
– Mark any stew containing milk powder, groundnut paste, or other high-risk ingredients.

Recipe tweaks & alternatives
– Offer a mild-pepper version of the core rice dishes or keep pepper sauce separate.
– Provide a dairy-free variant of the standard stew (use oil + tomato base only).

Service workflow
– Train serving staff to ask, “Pepper okay?” for rice or banku dishes.
– Segregate ladles and prep stations for pepper sauces to prevent cross-contamination.

Data capture improvements
– Replace the free-text allergy box with a tick-list of common allergens so diners don’t forget fish, gluten, soy, etc.
– Continue tracking selections so the kitchen can quantify how many allergen-friendly portions are needed each day.

Communication
– Publish a weekly “safe-option” list (e.g., boiled yam + egg stew with no pepper, plain rice + tomato gravy) so allergic staff know what to request.
