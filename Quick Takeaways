Here is a first-pass story emerging from the cleaned file:

Department participation
– Security and Quality Control together supply almost half of all responses, followed by Production and Packaging. Smaller groups such as Audit, IT and HR contribute the rest. The bar chart highlights the skew clearly; any subsidy forecasting or menu planning should weight demand toward the big four functions.

Allergy landscape
– Roughly 17 % of employees say they have allergies or special dietary needs. This is a non-trivial minority; menu rotation should always include an allergy-friendly option.

Subsidy sign-up
– Virtually everyone (98 %) opted-in for the May-week-five subsidy, confirming high enthusiasm for the canteen programme.

Banku & Fish dominates, followed by Kenkey & Fish and Jollof.
Submission activity started on 20 Mar 2025 and peaks on 21 Mar; no obvious long-tail trend yet.
Allergy declarations vary significantly across departments so some teams need special menus.
104 respondents left every meal field blank—worth chasing for confirmation.
Each department’s top pick is almost always Banku & Fish; only a few break the pattern (see full table if needed).
