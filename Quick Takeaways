Here is a first-pass story emerging from the cleaned file:

Department participation
– Security and Quality Control together supply almost half of all responses, followed by Production and Packaging. Smaller groups such as Audit, IT and HR contribute the rest. 
The bar chart highlights the skew clearly; any subsidy forecasting or menu planning should weight demand toward the big four functions.

Allergy landscape
– Roughly 17 % of employees say they have allergies or special dietary needs. This is a non-trivial minority; menu rotation should always include an allergy-friendly option.

Subsidy sign-up
– Virtually everyone (98 %) opted-in for the May-week-five subsidy, confirming high enthusiasm for the canteen programme.

What the allergic count chart tells us

Rice-based dishes—especially “Rice & Stew” variants—have the highest share of allergic diners (≈23 %).
Classic favourites like Banku (all versions) and Beans & Rice also see ~18-20 % allergy rates, so they’re not automatically “safe”.
Even very popular meals (e.g., Banku & Fish) still carry a substantial allergy burden because of sheer volume.
How to use this

Flag the top 5-7 dishes for recipe reviews (ingredient audits, cross-contamination checks).
Offer labeled alternatives when serving rice dishes.
Communicate these findings to the kitchen team so they can prioritise allergen-free prep zones on high-risk days.

Banku & Fish dominates, followed by Kenkey & Fish and Jollof.
Submission activity started on 20 Mar 2025 and peaks on 21 Mar; no obvious long-tail trend yet.
Allergy declarations vary significantly across departments so some teams need special menus.
104 respondents left every meal field blank—worth chasing for confirmation.
Each department’s top pick is almost always Banku & Fish; only a few break the pattern (see full table if needed).

What the allergy heatmap reveals

“Pepper” is by far the most-mentioned trigger. It tops every meal with a chili-based sauce or stew, peaking at ≈4 % of all Rice & Stew selections.
A few meals draw smaller—but notable—flags for dairy and nuts (e.g. Rice and Stew shows ≈2 % mentions of each).
Other classic allergens (fish, gluten, soy, shellfish) barely appear in free-text responses; either diners didn’t list them or they aren’t a major concern for this group.
Action points

Highlight pepper/spice content on the menu board; offer mild alternatives or separate sauce bowls.
Audit the rice‐and‐stew recipes for hidden dairy or nut ingredients and consider a clearly dairy-free variant.
Keep gathering specific allergy data so the kitchen can refine labels—today’s free-text hints are useful but still sparse.
